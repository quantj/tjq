## The Challenge

In an age of chain coffee dominance, discovering quality independent cafés has become increasingly difficult. Existing solutions like Google Maps prioritize larger chains and paid placements, while coffee enthusiasts seek authentic, local experiences. The problem space included:

* **Discovery Gap**: No dedicated platform for finding independent coffee shops
* **Data Fragmentation**: Coffee shop information scattered across multiple sources
* **Poor User Experience**: Generic map interfaces not optimized for coffee discovery
* **Mobile-First Need**: Users discovering cafés while on the go

---

## The Solution

Built a geolocation-based web application that helps users discover independent cafés by integrating public APIs with data automation and clean UX design. The platform focuses on:

### Core Features

**Geolocation-First Design**
* Automatic user location detection
* Real-time proximity-based café recommendations
* Interactive map interface for spatial discovery

**Data Integration**
* Public API integration for café information
* Automated data validation and enrichment
* Regular data refresh cycles to maintain accuracy

**Clean, Fast UX**
* Mobile-responsive design
* Sub-second load times
* Minimal, distraction-free interface
* Progressive web app capabilities
