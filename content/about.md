Before tech, I worked in interior and 3D design. That experience shaped how I think about systems, details, and how people actually use things. It’s not a typical path into product, but it still shows up in how I work.

These days I’m a product manager who likes getting into the weeds, especially when there’s a messy problem to clean up. I spend a lot of time deciding what’s actually worth fixing, then working with engineers to simplify and automate workflows, often around reporting and internal tools, so teams aren’t stuck babysitting brittle manual processes.

Outside of work, I build small projects in Google Sheets, climb, and tinker with 3D stuff.
