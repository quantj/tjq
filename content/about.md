Before tech, I designed spaces—interiors and 3D environments. That background taught me to think in systems, sweat the details, and build things people actually want to use. It's an unconventional path to product management, but it's why I approach roadmaps like blueprints and treat user experience as non-negotiable.

Most of my work happens in the trenches with engineering teams, turning ambiguity into working products. I occasionally write about what I've learned along the way.

Outside work: lifelong rock climber, 3D hobbyist, and a Google Sheets loyalist.
