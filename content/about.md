# About Me

I work best when collaborating across engineering, UX, and go-to-market teams—turning ideas into real-world solutions. Before finding my path in tech, I started in interior design and 3D visualization, which taught me early the value of thoughtful space, good design, and building with intention. That creative mindset still fuels how I approach product work today.

Outside of work, I'm a 3D printing hobbyist, a rock climber, a Google Sheet fan and a strong believer that creativity isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a necessary tool for solving real problems and building things that last.
